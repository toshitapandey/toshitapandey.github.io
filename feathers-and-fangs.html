                <h3 style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">Feathers and Fangs</h3>
                <p>Recently I came across a quote by Georges Bataille, which said, 
                    <br>
                    "No greater desire exists than a wounded person's need for another wound"
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And I got to thinking
                    <br>
                    Thank god there are others like me 
                    <br>
                    Thank god I am not the only one being tagged "crazy" by the "normal" world
                    <br>
                    But maybe, they are not really normal
                    <br>
                    They just have higher threshold 
                    <br>
                    Or maybe they just did not endure enough
                    <br>
                    Maybe they do bleed through their sweaty palms
                    <br>
                    But decide to not go through that again 
                    <br>
                    Maybe they too are fearful of the uncertainty around
                    <br>
                    But unlike us, they are skilled to handle things, 
                    <br>
                    While we slit, to feel the void inside us a little less
                    <br>
                    They walk the path, with their head held high
                    <br>
                    
                    How did we stumble upon this path where there was no other choice
                    <br>
                    While so many got the choice, to be, to exist
                    <br>
                    How much can we endure after all?
                    <br>
                    How many more times, should we hear "crazy", "unlovable" -- and yet carry on with a smile
                    <br>
                    
                    Now I put my foot down
                    <br>
                    I am not crazy
                    <br>
                    I am just different 
                    <br>
                    I am not unlovable
                    <br>
                    They just don't have the right pair of lenses
                    <br>
                    
                    My story won't be written in scribble with fangs, but by feathers
                    <br>
                    And I WILL tell my story out loud 
                    <br>
                    Coz my wounds might be raw,
                    <br>
                    But now I won't just write "pain" over and over again. </p>
