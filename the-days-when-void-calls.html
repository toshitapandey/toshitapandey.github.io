                <h3 style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">For the days when void screams</h3>
                <p>This is to anyone out there, who is struggling. There will be days when you feel so lost and so alone that nothing and no one seems important. Like you are sitting diagonally opposite to a Zen mode, where nihilism is prominent on most days. Where even the silence screams and the void expands inside your heart.  Where you want to acknowledge the call of the void and the voice telling you not to, is too mild. What do you do? Where do you go? </p>
	
                <p>Well, it's the last month of this bumpy year 2021 - and it seems like my mental health went through a scary roller coaster ride. Well, I am not sure at this moment, if I feel happy that this year is ending because it caused so much pain, or am I sad because it caused so much pain and I couldn’t fix it all in this year itself. </p>
                
                <p>From sleeping for three to four days at a time, hearing voices, and seeing shadows that did not exist, to buying everything in the store because I wanted to cook something elaborate and royal for myself. From dragging myself to work (often failing), to completing everything in one stretch because that fine day a voice in my head said that I love my work too much. From being in a state where even breathing seemed like a chore, to cleaning the entire house in one go because I wanted to smell the potpourri I bought 5 weeks ago. From walking in the kitchen to fetch a glass of water and seeing unwashed utensils from 2 weeks ago because I didn’t have enough strength to live - let alone do adulting chores, to finally accepting that I need help in behavioral aspects — it has been quite a journey.</p>
                
                <p>For months, things were really sad and gloomy, and it seemed like this would never end. The feeling that I would not be able to do anything in life and that my entire existence is for nothing crept so deep inside, that every waking moment had become a nightmare just like the ones I had when I was asleep. The dream reality confusion (DRC) and audio-visual hallucinations made it worse. And in the small bursts that I’d be wide awake, all I could think of was “what if I just kept sleeping and never woke up, would anyone bother to even care? Or if they did, how long would it take? Or do I even care about anyone else or just this long weird life of mine to end?”.</p>
                
                <p>The disorders often make you so lonely that you can’t see beyond the fog that they create. They turn into this demon, who keeps a tab on everything you do, and ensures that you stay trapped within its reach. While this demon keeps on doing its job, the “normal” humans keep on telling you how abnormal you are, and how they need normalcy and not a loony bin like you. Apparently, when it comes to helping with depression and anxiety (maybe the most well-understood terms of the entire umbrella of mental health issues - and even that’s not understood properly), people support them wholeheartedly but only from a safe distance. They can give donations in the name of mental health but need “normalcy” in their own life. And this attitude feeds the demon and makes it grow stronger and you give in - you wanna stay in its grasp, where although toxicity and helplessness and sadness exist, at least it exists in a familiar zone and you wanna stay around familiarity.</p>
                
                <p>Recently I came across this quote by Franz Kafka from Letters to Felice that I resonated with a lot. It said: "I am not well; I could have built the Pyramids with the effort it takes me to cling on to life and reason." It has been the same for me, clinging to life and gathering the strength to wake up every day, ensuring I survive one day at a time - all of this drains so much energy that can’t even be explained in words to “normal” people.</p>
                
                <p>While all of this was happening and, I was going to and fro at the same routing like a pendulum — super excited for some hours and super gloomy on others — a voice in my head got very strong and asked me to get help.</p>
                
                <p>About three months ago, I crawled back to professional help and this new psychiatrist of mine talked to me like everything in the world was perfect. Like I was perfectly imperfect, just the way I was. Like nothing wrong was happening - and though I wanted to believe her, the demon’s voice in my head kept on telling me otherwise - and medications also were not helping me much. While she kept on trying new medications, she finally found the one that would be just right for me.</p>
                
                <p>The last couple of weeks have been nothing but a sweet and beautiful dream. It feels like I am walking on clouds — but not in mania. I am waking up to the alarm clock, working like I want to, cooking for myself every day, spreading happiness — it feels surreal as if my soul had been taken out but now it is back to where it belongs, and hence I belong. I feel like I wasn’t myself for over a year and now those pieces are gluing themselves back. For sure, they are leaving some scars in the process but these are reminders of how broken things and people can heal with some support. </p>
                
                <p>I still have some bad moments, but my reaction has turned into a response. The intensity of emotions has stabilized and I feel like I’m in my body again. Although I do worry how long will I be like this, and will I slip up soon into the same spiral, in the grasp of the same demon — I love myself a little more, and more importantly, I am able to embrace and accept myself a little more — because why not.</p>
                
                <p>On days when the void screams and the struggle strangles you — know that there are people out there ready to help you, you just need to extend that one little finger. It will be difficult, it will be hard, and you might even need to drag yourself out of the haven because it is not safe anymore — but in the end, the result is all worth that step out of the comfort zone. So, take that one step into your own journey, and accept the beautiful soul that you are — you deserve all the colors and all the rainbows in this universe. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Yours truly,</p>
                
                <p>A borderline & schizophrenic who is scared to accept herself as who she is but hopes to believe one day that she is all the colors in one, at full brightness.</p>
